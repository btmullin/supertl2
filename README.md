# Project Name

Making pass #2 at creating a replacement for SportTracks 3.0.

Instead of a QT app this time going to try some sort of webframework
dockerized something or other.  Got way too sidetracked on version 1.0
with how to make a GUI and never even got off the ground with actually
getting a training log going.
